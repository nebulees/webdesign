User testing sessions went well, this was meant to come across as a more professional website, though with the color pallete I chose, it doesn't entirely come across that way, I might need to change it. 

I removed a lot of excessive exclamations and made it a bit more streamlined, for example adding the menu on top intead of just putting links at the bottom. 

The biggest challenge was fighting work and getting the motivation to do this at all.
