It hasn't been too bad since i have some experience working with it, outside of trying to skip ahead and getting stuck, then to go back and figure out what i'm supposed to do. The hard part is remembering what does what, and how things interact with each other. Though that also may be the point of html... I dunno. 

I'm super scared to learn CSS... If I remember right I really struggled with that last time I tried to jump into this, so hopefully it all goes well.
