Typography is important because with text, and how it is arranged on a page, it's going to make the difference between something looking professional or not. Even if you have incredible graphics, if your typography is a load of bull... It's not gonna work. 

Sometimes a font isn't avaiable on a specific software or computer. I work with both windows and macs. They are both so different, you could also be looking at a sit from a phone, and text is going to break if you don't have that available font, and its just going to look trashy. 

Websafe fonts are typically going to be the fonts on every single computer. They're considered web safe. Syatem fonts are fonts already installed on your computer. A web font is designed for well, the web, using css and designed for web use. 

I couldn't figure out google fonts, so i borrowed the ones you used.... I hope that's okay.
