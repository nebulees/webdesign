I feel like I wasn't supposed to but what I did was I used it to view a couple of deleted youtube channels. It was nice to view old videos that were thought to be long gone were now here. It was back in 2020. I couldn't quite remember it. Youtube is still the same, but the site that I specifically used it for is different.
