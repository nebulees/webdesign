The universal selector is used to style every element on a page. You'd want to use this mostly for general coding, think of it like a title page for coding. 
The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. It helps make editing certain parts of a webpage easier. Rather than having to edit everything 
The class selector is similar to the element, but it's more percise and allows for easier manipulation of certain elements within those parts i mentioned earlier. 
Id selector makes allows you to change the rules entirely, instead of having to split everything up to edit one part, which can make the code clucky, you can edit the elemetn within the element. 

I just really love the contrast of colors in a place someone would expect to be black and white, and I generally love light pinks purples and yellows in general, and I really liked the asethsetic of this. So yea. That's why I chose this. 

My challenge this week? willing myself to do anything tbh
