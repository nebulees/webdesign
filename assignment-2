Here's the foloder for assignment 2
Directory mostly refers to the structural organization of files, like trees, It's like the files are a tree, and the directory referrs to the system of files. 
Version control centers help so mutiple people can work on a file at the same time. It creates timestamps and different versions of the same file that other people have edited.
They basically make it easier to work on a project, if you don't like something, you can always pull from a backup. 
Digital? Mostly because it's something you can do a lot with, and honestly also because my husband and sister love using digital art, and I like their art.
