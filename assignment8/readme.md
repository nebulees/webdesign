Affordance is a property or feature of an object which presents a prompt on what can be done with this object.
Baiscally it's how we control what we can do with... stuff on websites. 

I think the advantages are definately the ease of having videos on your site, its easier to upload the video, and get the embed to put on your website, and not only that it gets views on that website, so there's the potential for profit from the views themselves. 

Though the video can always get taken down from that third party service.... So there's that drawback, and copyright is a big deal on youtube. Though it typically is everywhere anyway. It's just so much harsher on those third party services. Even if it's under fair use, it has the chance of getting mistakenly copyright flagged. 

This week was just a lot... I got impatient with the video and thought i had to type out everything.... Turns out after rewatch I was fine.......... We're not gonna talk about it
